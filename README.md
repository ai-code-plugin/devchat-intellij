## What is DevChat?

DevChat is an open-source platform that empowers developers to more effectively integrate AI into code generation and
documentation. DevChat aims to go beyond simple code auto-completion and limited operations on code snippets. DevChat
offers a highly *practical* and *effective* way for developers to interact and collaborate with large language models (
LLMs).

## Why DevChat?

While there are many AI coding tools available, we developed DevChat based on our practical insights from generating
tens of thousands of lines of code. DevChat makes the following distinctive design choices:

- **Precise manual control over the context embedded in a prompt**. Precise control over context is the key to effective
  AI use. We find that most other "intelligent" or "automatic" tools tend to over-guess what a user needs to put into a
  prompt. That typically introduces more noise than LLMs can effectively manage.
- **A simple, extensible prompt directory**. Bring your own prompts, and build a library of what works for you and your
  team. Easily integrate your own prompt templates into DevChat, avoiding significant engineering effort or a steep
  learning curve. You don't need a complex framework to make AI work for you. All it takes is a standard editor
  operating on your filesystem.

## What is Prompt-Centric Software Development (PCSD)?

- The traditional code-centric paradigm is evolving. Stay ahead of the curve with DevChat.

- Write prompts to create code. Transform prompts into all the artifacts in software engineering.
